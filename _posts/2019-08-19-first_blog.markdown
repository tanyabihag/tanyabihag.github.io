This is not quite related to the content that I learned during my first week of bootcamp bu t I jsut wanted to note this somewhere so I dont lose it. A friend of mine brought up an idea about an IOS application. Its goal is to help local families who are great in the kithcen but do not have the funds or experience needed to build a restaurant. The cook will be able to share and post pictures of their dish on the app and the consumer will be able to pick and choose what they would like to order. Local families will be able to cook from the comfort of their own home and make some money set with their own hours of availability. 

-This is somewhat related to what we're learning ebcause all I could think about was how would I start programming this app. I then got excited and suddenly gained huge interest it building mobile apps, maybe one that could help my community.
